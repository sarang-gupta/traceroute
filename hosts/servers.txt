# List of servers in text format, since that's easier to edit than a database

# TODO: write program to SQLite3 database-ify these
# TODO: write program to check which servers are down
# TODO: some servers require IP address and won't resolve hostnames: note these

# NOTE: initial version(s) may be very raw and not really usable
# NOTE: the lat/lon format is somewhat ugly

# EXAMPLE: 23s3251 means 22 degrees, 32 minutes, 51 seconds south;
# seconds are normally excluded, however

# %IP% is replaced by target IP

# post = post data, only if required
