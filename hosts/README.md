Files here:

  - current-codematches.txt: codes and hostnames for hostnames that
  match a code

  - hostnames.txt: The list of hostnames I've seen while running the
  TRACEROUTE project previously; can be used for testing.

  - all-traceroutes.txt.bz2: edited output from all traceroutes the
  traceroute project has performed (including "Subject" which often
  shows source/target, and "Date" which shows date). I have made an
  attempt to remove non-traceroute information (primarily to avoid
  posting personally identifiable information about other people), so
  this file is NOT in MBX format.

  - mostneeded.txt: see README.md in parent directory

  - reversehosts.txt: see README.md in parent directory

You can probably safely ignore everything below this line.

  - servers.txt: A list of traceroute servers that were probably
  current when this file was originally created, but may not be
  current now.

  - Makefile: a Makefile that at one point created/updated some files,
  but probably no longer works
