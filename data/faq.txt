S: General Questions

Q: What is the Sarangworld Traceroute Project?

A: The Sarangworld Traceroute Project is an attempt to map the path between
Internet-connected machines to geographic locations

Q: How does it work?

A: As a first step, the program will perform a traceroute from a public
traceroute server to any given hostname. By default, the traceroute is
performed from a randomly chosen traceroute server to your IP address, but
this can be changed. After the traceroute is performed, each hostname is
matched against a <a href="patterns.php3">list of patterns</a> to see if it
matches a known pattern. If it does match a known pattern, a "code" value
is extracted and this code is then <a href="showdb-2.php3">converted to a
city, state, country location</a>. Finally, using a database of city
latitudes and longitudes, the location of the hostname is mapped.

Q: Why don't you use the WHOIS record? Why is this better than the IP to
Latitude/Longitude program?

A: The <a href="/extlink.php3?http://cello.cs.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/slamm/ip2ll">IP to
Latitude/Longitude program</a> use the WHOIS record of a hostname to
determine location. The WHOIS record yields the location of the
administrative office for the organization/person that owns that
domain. For local ISPs and many others, the WHOIS record provides an
accurate location. However, for large ISPs (such as alter.net), the WHOIS
record is necessarily sometimes inaccurate, because Earthlink has
routers/machines all over the country. For example, the WHOIS record for
alter.net shows they are in Falls Church, VA. However, the machines
"132.ATM3-0.XR2.SEA1.ALTER.NET", "198.ATM7-0.XR2.BOS1.ALTER.NET", and
"110.ATM7-0.TR2.NYC1.ALTER.NET" are clearly in Seattle, Boston, and New
York respectively.<p>

Q: If the WHOIS record is accurate for 90% of all domains, why bother with
pattern matching and code conversion?

A: The 90-10 rule applies here. Roughly speaking, 90% of the Internet's
traffic is carried by 10% of all domains (actually, it's probably more like
99.99%-00.01%, since there are millions of domains and only a few dozen
major ISPs). So, while the WHOIS record might be accurate for 90% of all
domains, the domains its <b>inaccurate</b> for are actually far more
important. You'll notice that in most traceroutes, the same top-level
domains (alter.net, earthlink.net and its subsidiaries, verio.net,
flash.net, etc) show up over and over again. All of these companies have
country-wide and sometimes worldwide prescense, so a single WHOIS location
could never be accurate for them.

Q: Why traceroute to a given host instead of just converting that host
directly to a location?

A: Converting a single host to a location is actually harder than using
traceroute to find the location. As an example, if you're dialing up from a
local ISP, your IP address maybe "dialup-17.somelocalisp.net". Unless that
local ISP is in my list of patterns (which it's usually not), there's no
way to convert that address to a location. On the other hand, if a
traceroute to your IP address shows the penultimate step as
"dca0.iad3.verio.net", it's pretty easy to see that machine is in
Washington DC (both DCA and IAD are airport codes for airports in
Washington DC). Verio.net is included in my list of patterns because it's a
major provider. From this, I can guess you're in Washington DC as
well. This isn't always accurate, but it's more accurate than trying to
convert just your IP address with no additional information.

Q: What about DNS LOC (RFC 1876)?

A: <a href="/extlink.php3?http://www.ckdhr.com/dns-loc/">DNS-LOC</a> is an addition to
the DNS protocol that lets machines provide their physical location
(latitude and longitude) as part of the DNS record. If and when it becomes
widely supported, there will no longer be a need for my project. However,
at the moment, few machines support this protocol.

Q: Why not use top-level country codes (like .uk) to determine the location
of a machine?

A: Actaully, country codes are no longer a good indication of the physical
location of a machine in many cases. As an example, <a
href="/extlink.php3?http://www.register.com/">Register.Com</a> allows people worldwide to
register domains with country codes .uk (United Kingdom), .ro (Romania),
.ms (Montserrat), .il (Israel), .sh (St. Helena), .gs (South Georgia), .vg
(British Virgin Islands), .nz (New Zealand), .fm (Micronesia), .to (Tonga),
.tf, .as (American Samoa), .dk (Denmark), .lt (Lithuania), .kz
(Kazakhstan), .tc (Turks & Cairn Islands), .md (Moldova), .ly (Libya), .ac
(Ascension Island), .za (South Africa), .ky (Cayman Islands), and .ws
(Samoa), without regard to where the machines hosting these domains will be
located.

Q: Is pattern-matching and code conversion the best way to find the
locations of Internet-connected machines?

A: Probably not -- I originally started the project when I noticed several
machine names had "obvious" cities embedded in them. I tried to find a
quick and dirty way to convert these machine names to locations, and this
is what I came up with. The method I use turns out to be remarkably
easy-to-use (for example "DFW" means Dallas, Texas, USA, regardless of
which ISP uses it-- so I don't need a seperate set of entries for each
ISP), but is probably non-optimal in other ways. I'd be interested in
hearing about other ways to do this.

Q: Whose traceroute servers do you use?

A: I use publically available traceroute servers only. I started with
the <b>Boardwatch Traceroute Server Index</b> (no longer available
online), and omitted those servers that were down or would only
traceroute to a specific IP address. I also omitted those servers that
didn't support the ISINDEX/GET protocol. Currently, my program only
supports traceroute servers that can be accessed using a URL followed
by a question mark followed by a hostname/IP address. In other words,
"http://some.server.net/somepathname.ext?TARGET_HOST_OR_IP".

Q: What if I don't want my server listed?

A: As a gesture of goodwill, I sent an email to all traceroute server
administrators to let them know I was including their server on my list. If
you would prefer not to be part of this project, please send me an email.

Q: What sorts of traceroute servers do you support?

A: Currently, only those traceroute servers supporting the ISINDEX/GET
protocol are supported. I access "SERVER_URL?TARGET_HOST_OR_IP" to perform
the traceroute.

Q: Are there any other (online or offline) programs that map machines
to geographical locations?

A: There are several. Martin Dodge maintains an excellent list at <a
href="http://www.cybergeography.org/atlas/routes.html">http://www.cybergeography.org/atlas/routes.html</a>.

S: Code Questions

Q: Where can I see a list of codes you use?

A: <a href="showdb-2.php3">Right here</a>.

Q: What does the code [START] mean?

A: This is a dummy code used to indicate the point where the traceroute
starts. Since I already know the locations of the traceroute servers
themselves, the first location displayed/mapped is taken directly from the
location of the traceroute server and not from the code.

Q: Why are the codes in the code database biased towards the United States?

A: This project started out as an attempt to map Internet hosts in the
United States only. Now that it's been expanded, I hope to add more
international codes as well.

Q: Isn't it possible for two different ISPs to use a single code to mean
different things?

A: Yes. This isn't a problem for codes like "LAX" which almost universally
will mean Los Angeles, CA, USA, but a code like "POR" might mean Portland,
OR, USA for one ISP and Portland, ME, USA for another-- and these two
Portlands are 3000+ miles apart. I haven't run into this situation so far,
but, if I do, I'll alter the list of patterns to separate these cases (eg,
"POR" found in an alter.net host could be recodified as "POR.alter.net" and
"POR" found in a local-maine.net host could be recofidied as
"POR.local-maine.net", so the two codes would no longer be the same)

S: Map Questions

Q: How is the map created?

A: The blank map of the United States is a static image which I originally
downloaded from the <a href="/extlink.php3?http://tiger.census.gov/">U.S. Census Bureau
TIGER mapping service</a>. The city dots and names are then added using a
libgd-extension to PHP3.

Q: Why isn't the map in GIF format?

A: The map is in PNG (portable network graphics) format, because our
version of PHP3 doesn't have GIF support installed for copyright
reasons. I support open-source software, and prefer using PNG
anyway. If you can't view PNG files, click on the checkbox marked "Use
JPEG format?" to see the map in JPEG format. Because JPEGs aren't as
good for line drawing (such as maps), the map appears a bit fuzzier in
JPEG mode.

Q: Why do the city names sometimes overlap on the map?

A: The placement of city names is done in a very simplistic manner-- the
city name is place to the "southeast" of the dot representing the city. If
two cities are nearby, their names will overlap (it might be possible to
work around this, but I haven't explored this). This problem is especially
prevelant near the East and West Coast, since the US East Coast has several
large cities packed together tightly, and both the East and West coast have
major hubs of Internet activity -- Mae-West in San Jose, California and
Mae-East in Washington, DC.

Q: Why does the map sometimes show lines leading to/from nowhere?

A: Since the map only represents the US, locations outside the US are not
displayed. However, lines leading TO/FROM those locations ARE still
displayed. So, the lines leading to/from nowhere are actually going to/from
locations that aren't displayed on the map.

Q: (OBSOLETE) Why does the map only show locations in the United States?

A: I originally started the project to map Internet machines in the United
States. Since then, I've decided to expand the project to be worldwide, but
I haven't had a chance to update the map. Using a world map for each and
every traceroute probably isn't a good idea (especially considering how
scrunched together some cities are already), so I'm trying to find a good
compromise.

Q: What is the projection for the maps?

A: The world map is projected rectangularly, so each degree of
latitude and longitude takes up exactly the same number of pixels
(4.444 pixels/degree to be specific). The US map is projected
elliptically, which looks better when mapping smaller areas. I
considered projecting the world map elliptically as well, but it
didn't look as good.

Q: Why do the maps draw inaccurate "shortest path" lines?

A: The shortest distance between two points on Earth (remaining on or
above the surface of the planet) is a "great circle", which is not a
straight line on either elliptical or rectangular projections. This is
less noticeable on the US map (since it's a smaller area), but can be
quite noticeable on the world map. In particular, if you fly from
Albuquerque, NM to Tokyo, Japan, you fly northwest in real life, but,
on the map, Tokyo appears far to the east of Albuquerque. Similarly,
Australia is actually west of California, not east as the map shows.

Q: What is the status of the world map?

A: The world map is in experimental/beta status. I realize that it's
uglier than the US map, and that it shows the whole world even when
the traceroute is limited to only a small portion of the world. It
would be neat to have a world map drawn dynamically that only shows
the extent of the traceroute, but I haven't gotten that working yet.

Q: How is the world map created?

A: I downloaded a static image of the world from the <a
href="http://mapweb.parc.xerox.com/">XEROX PARC MapWeb Server</a>. The
city names are added the same as for the US map.

S: Technical Questions

Q: Where can I see a list of the patterns you use?

A: <a href="patterns.php3">Right here</a>.

S: How Can I Help?

Q: How can I help?

A: There are several ways you can help: <ul>

<li>If you're tracerouting to yourself, the last location listed in the
table and on the map should be your city. If it's not, let me know which
city the traceroute server put you at versus which city you're actually in.

<li>If you've created a public traceroute server on your machine
(especially if you live in an area not already covered) or if you know of
additional traceroute servers supporting the ISINDEX/GET protocol, I would
love to add them to my list. If you're interested in creating a traceroute
server, let me know and I might be able to help out. Traceroute servers can
be created in Perl, PHP3, or even Bourne-shell language. Because a public
traceroute server might place a heavy load on your machine, please be sure
to get your system administrator's permission before proceeding.

<li>If you can tell me how to convert a major ISPs hostnames to
geographical locations (either because you work for a major ISP or have
observed a pattern), this information would be very useful.

<li>If you run across an unresolved code when doing a traceroute, and know
how to resolve that code, please let me know.

<li>If you run across an unresolved pattern ("NA" for "Matched Pattern")
for a major ISP, let me know. However, if you see an "NA" for "Matched
Pattern" for a small local ISP, please ignore it.

<li>If you see any errors in the list of code conversions (or anywhere
else), let me know.

</ul>

Q: Should I give you the physical location of my machines?

A: If you work for an ISP that carries traffic to many locations
countrywide or worldwide, then yes please! On the other hand, if you work
for a small ISP with all machines in one city, this information wouldn't be
as useful to me-- in this case, most likely, all of your traffic comes
through a major ISP router and it would be the location/translation of the
major ISP router that I would want.

S: Miscellaneous Questions

Q: What are your feelings on privacy issues related to this program?

A: I'm a strong advocate of privacy and anonymity. I realize not everyone
wants to announce their physical location. At one point, I even asked
flash.net to change their machine names so as not to reveal the physical
locations of their dialup users (they never answered my query). I believe
this project is interesting because it automatically translates the
information already provided by ISPs, but it's not invasive and doesn't
seek to extract additional information. If it came to a choice between
continuing this project or convincing ISPs to stop providing location
information on their users, I would choose the latter.

Q: What if my question isn't answered here?

A: Please contact me via email and I'll see what I can do.

Q: According to the pull-down menu, Sarangworld is located in Ogden,
UT, USA. Do you live in Ogden?

A: No, I live in Albuquerque, NM, USA. However, my Internet provider
(webpipe.net) is located in Ogden.

S: Errors

Q: When using the program, I sometimes see a listing under code, but
there's no city/state/country/latitude/longitude listed?

A: The pattern-matching will sometimes end up extracting a code for which
the code database doesn't have a translation (a "bogus code"). Whenever
this happens, I'm alerted by email and will try to find a code-to-city
conversion. If you see this happening and know of a code conversion, please
send me an email to let me know.

Q: When using the program, I sometimes get weird errors.

A: The Internet works very well, but not perfectly-- sometimes servers are
slow or down, and the program will be unable to perform a traceroute. The
best strategy is to try again later. However, if you run into a problem
that can be repeated consistently, let me know about it.
